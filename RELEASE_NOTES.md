# Release Notes

## [1.0.0] - 2025-01-04

### Fellow Collectors - The Grind Just Got Easier

**The situation:** Madam Nazar wants complete sets. Every day. Coins scattered from Annesburg to Blackwater. Arrowheads buried where God forgot. Tarot Cards hidden in every dusty saloon from here to Tumbleweed. And you? You're squinting at hand-drawn maps, scribbling notes on scraps of paper, trying to remember which creekbed you already checked. Other collectors are out there too, racing you to every site. Your saddlebags are half-full, your patience worn thin.

**The solution:** One map. Your map. Press **M** and see every collectible Madam Nazar's after, marked clear as day. Pan around the frontier, plan your route, mark what you've already collected. No more juggling papers, no more wondering if that's today's locations or last week's. Just ride out and collect.

**What this does:** Marks today's collectibles right on your in-game map. Open your map, see the locations, plan your route. Simple as that.

**Breaking character for a second:** Those "hand-drawn maps" and "scribbled notes"? That's **[Jean Ropke's RDR2 Collectors Map](https://jeanropke.github.io/RDR2CollectorsMap/)**, and it's the foundation this entire overlay is built on. Jean has been maintaining accurate daily cycle data, collectible locations, and video guides for YEARS, completely free. This tool wouldn't exist without that work. All this overlay does is bring Jean's data into your in-game map so you don't have to alt-tab.

### This Is v1.0 - There's Work To Do

This release is **functional and useful**, but not perfect. Map tracking is smooth while viewing. 1920√ó1080 only right now.

**Feedback is gold.** If something breaks, feels clunky, or you have ideas - open an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/asd007/RDOCollectorMapOverlay/issues). This tool gets better with your input.

**Known limitations:**
- Resolution: 1920√ó1080 only
- Window mode: Requires Windowed Fullscreen
- Map view: Works on the full in-game map (M), not minimap or radar
- Performance: ~500MB RAM, ~5-10% CPU (similar to Discord)
